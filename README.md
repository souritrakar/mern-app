# mern-app


This is a simple exercise-tracker web-application, made with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js). This is my first MERN stack app, and it is based on the tutorial by FreeCodeCamp. I have made some changes, and I plan to build much bigger and structured projects in the future. Thank you!
